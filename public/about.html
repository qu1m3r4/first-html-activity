<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Carlos, and I'm from Spain. While I currently immerse myself in the fascinating world of languages as a student, my true passion lies in the sphere of technology and computer science. I am particularly captivated by web development, artificial intelligence, and the power of new technologies to shape our future. What intrigues me most is exploring how the richness of tradition can elegantly converge with modernity through these technological advancements, creating unique and innovative solutions.</p>

<p>I am actively pursuing new skills in both fields. I am currently taking my first steps into web development—as demonstrated by this initial HTML exercise—and also specializing in technical and specialized translation. This portfolio represents the very beginning of my journey to learn and master these dynamic disciplines. I am highly motivated and dedicated to continuous learning, striving to build a strong foundation in both coding and communication.</p>

<p>I am enthusiastic about the opportunities ahead and am currently seeking employment that will allow me to apply and expand my burgeoning skills in either web development or specialized translation. This simple portfolio marks a small but significant first step, and I look forward to contributing to projects where my passion for technology and language can make a meaningful impact. Thank you for viewing my work!</p>
